GroundworkCSS Stand-Alone Grid System
====

Say hello to the last grid system you'll ever need.

[GroundworkCSS](http://groundwork.sidereel.com) is a responsive, fractions-based, 
nestable, fluid grid system created by [@ghepting](http://twitter.com/ghepting).


The GroundworkCSS Grid System is:

* fluid
* nestable
* responsive
* based on simple fractions
* range of fractions can easily be changed/optimized
* works on virtually anything: mobile, tablet, or large screen devices
* supports purely semantic implementations by utilizing Sass @extend, @mixin and 
  %placeholder classes
* highly configurable: customize the range of fractions, optional output of classes, gutter sizing, max container widths, etc.
